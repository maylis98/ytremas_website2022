Dive into the darkness and discover a mysterious meteor, through the testimonies of those who saw it fall ! 
The project is an immersive light and sound experience to visualize & simulates the way a rumor spreads and shapes an event: the more an event is relayed by various comments, the more it appears true. Here, the audio comments come from the American Meteor Society's database.
